# Just-Off-iOS

A Template iOS application developed for a client to port mobile websites into the mobile platform with push notification 
service. The application uses One-Signal (https://onesignal.com) as a platform to send notification to registered devices. 

One sample use of the app on the iOS app store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-off-uk/id1247634896?ls=1&mt=8

In order to generate your own version, replace the website URL on line 107 in ViewController.swift with your own URL, and 
replace line 20 in AppDelegate.swift with your own appID generated from https://onesignal.com.
